It is time! that we get started with the key player of our course.

Docker! Docker is an open platform for developers and system admins to build, ship, and run containerized

applications.

In other words, it is a containerization platform. Is Docker the

only platform of its kind?

Well, No! Certainly, there are others like rocket but Docker is definitely the dominant one.

By the time this course is being created, Docker is tried and tested and it is a top choice of industry

unanimously.

It means if you want to sharpen your containerization skills, Docker is potentially the best choice for various

reasons such as more industries are using it. so it can land you on more relevant jobs.

It is open source and has huge community support.

A lot of third party applications are available to support Docker. Although, it is built for Linux

It can be used on Windows and Mac OS.

for those who just don't have any other choice.

There are other aspects as well.

But there is no point on flooding your heads with information which you might not be able to relate to.

We will get into those later into this course. In the next lecture,

we will install Docker on a Linux machine.
